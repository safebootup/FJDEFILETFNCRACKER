Hello,
To run the code simply run the attached exe/py and then press space while clicked on the URL
You must have the keyboard module the command to download it is
```bash
pip install keyboard
```
or
```bash
py -m pip install keyboard
```
or
```bash
python -m pip install keyboard
```

to QUIT you press \
NOTE. THIS CODE WILL RUN IN THE BACKGROUND UNTIL YOU PRESS \ OR CTRL C THE CODE. ALWAYS PRESS \ THRICE FOR GOOD MEASURE

you can also press = for automation(it will automatically press space for you) but I wouldnt recommend doing that.
its easy to forget its in the background
